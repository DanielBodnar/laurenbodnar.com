post kid 1 I lost my identity
 had no inputs other than family and tv
  mental energy spent overthinking --> being anxious about family issues.

  Reading gave me life again. It sparks new ideas and fed my brain something to think about, consider my positions on, etc.

  Being a stay at home mom is wonderful for so many reasons, but it can also isolate you to the walls of your home and only communicating with tiny people if you let it. I felt like the only think I had to talk about with people was about my kids. My only news came from social media, my only cultural input was netflix.

  “Reading furnishes the mind only with materials of knowledge; it is thinking that makes what we read ours.”
― John Locke
