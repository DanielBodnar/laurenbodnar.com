Goals must be quantifiable and worth your effort.

If you can’t measure success, you can’t build momentum and reaching the goal is a futile effort. I set a variety of goals: intellectual, spiritual, and physical.

You must also have a reason for each goal. I won’t pursue something for long if not convinced of it’s worth and value.

**TL;DR 2019 goals:** 
— Finish reading the bible in it’s entirety
 — Reading challenge: 26 Books
 — Reduce tv time for Selah and myself
 — Establish and stick to a schedule / routine 
— Reach goal weight
 — Take the dog for more walks: goal 2–3 times a week

**Bible Reading:**

My pastor once shared an abysmal statistic. [Only 11%](https://lifewayresearch.com/2017/04/25/lifeway-research-americans-are-fond-of-the-bible-dont-actually-read-it/) of professing evangelical Christians have read the bible in it’s entirety. I was convicted. Having been in the church since childhood, I believed I had read it all at some point along the way. Not true — hello Obadiah, Nahum, Leviticus — and even if I had, how pitiful.

I resolved over the next few days to read it through relatively quickly. I began a chronological plan in August, and have since read Genesis — 2 Chronicles, several psalms, proverbs, and Job. I’m reading to gain a birds eye view of the whole. When I’m done I’ll dive back into individual study of specific books.

**Reading Challenge:**

I’m participating in the same [challenge by Tim Challies](https://www.challies.com/resources/the-2019-christian-reading-challenge/) as I did last year. I set my first reading goal in 2017 — 6 books and at the time I doubted my ability to do this. In [2018](https://medium.com/@laurenbodnar/reading-challenge-2018-b81b41a99d40) I more than doubled that goal and ended up finishing 15.

Doubling my previous goal again, I’m shooting for 26\. The challenge provides structure; causing me to read books I never would’ve picked up — my favorite part.

Want to join me? I’d love to have a few people keeping me accountable!

**Reduce TV time:** Despite all the reading I did, I managed to watch a lot of TV! 11 seasons of Grey’s Anatomy, 6 seasons of Gossip Girl and countless other TV junk. This doesn’t count shows and movies Daniel and I watched together. #netflixandchill

I began to reflect on this making several observations.

1.  I tend to binge watch and get irritable when something or someone pulls me away. This is the source of some of my worst parenting moments.
2.  I get consumed by the lives and drama of the characters, then lament the mundane life I lead in comparison. This is the source of some of my most depressed moments.

3\. I am not fulfilled nor am I rested by watching tv. I convince myself it’s the best way to relax and unwind, but in truth it’s an empty promise.

I hope to pursue more of what actually fulfills me this year — how else am I going to read 26 books?!?

**Other goals: 
**With less waisted time I plan to fill it in ways that benefit me and my family. I want to be a better mama to my dog and begin taking her on walks 2–3 times a week. I’ve given myself a pass considering I’ve been pregnant all year, but now’s the time pup, this is your year!

Setting goals that have overlapping benefits is also a good idea.

Walking the dog will help me reach my goal weight. It’s been a long time since I’ve set a weight related new years resolution, but now I have the resolve necessary. No gimmicks, no trendy diets, no gym membership. Portioned eating, family oriented exercise, and regular progress reports will build momentum and motivation.

With all this comes another goal I’ve longed for in my life. Schedule and routine — an area our family sucks at.

Selah’s getting older and ready for schooling activities and intentionality. Having a routine is a must.

I’m gonna get my act together and stick to a schedule. Except when I fail, and there’s grace and mercies anew each morning.

Here’s to 2019. Cheers.
